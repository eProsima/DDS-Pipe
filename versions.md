# DDS-Pipe Versions

This file includes the released versions of **DDS-Pipe** project along with their contributions to the project.
The *Forthcoming* section includes those features added in `main` branch that are not yet in a stable release.

## Forthcoming

The upcoming release will include the following features:
* Support Ubuntu Noble (24.04).
* Stop supporting Ubuntu Focal (20.04).

## eProsima DDS Pipe v0.4.0

This release includes the following *new features*:
* Implement a Monitor module to report internal information of the DDS Pipe.
* Add new warnings reported:
  - Topic with type mismatch: reader found a remote Writer with the same topic name but incompatible type.
  - Topic with QoS mismatch: reader found a remote Writer with incompatible QoS.
  - Missing samples: on readers, a data sample has been lost on the reader and will not be received.
* Configure the publication of Fast DDS's logs through the YAML file.
* Configure the log displayed when running the DDS Pipe through the YAML file.

This release includes the following *internal changes* & *bugfixes*:
* Avoid potentially endless closures.
* Implement and update participant discovery callbacks in `CommonParticipant` to align with changes in Fast DDS middleware.
* Update `EchoPartcipant` to report participant undiscovered when updated and not active.
* Update `DiscoveryServerParticipant` to get logical port value from physical port.
* Distinguish `external_port` from `logical_port` in TCP configuration.
* Add Dll dependency to ``CommandlineArgs`` class.
* Fix inconsistent RTPS history attributes.

This release includes the following *dependencies update*:
